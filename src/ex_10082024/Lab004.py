# WAP to find max number between 2 integers.
# ex.  34,101
from sys import setdlopenflags

# print(max(34,101,515,1001,-1,81.3))
# print(max(34,101,515,1001,-1,81.3, "PC")) #will get an error because it will give an error, str and int cant not compare.
# age=30
# name="pc"
# value=3.14
# complex_num= 1+2j
# print(type(age))
# print(type(name))
# print(type(value))
# print(type(complex_num.real))
# print(type(complex_num.imag))

result = max(54, 45)
print(result)
